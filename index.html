						<h2>A multifunction car key for a multifunctional car</h2>
						
						<p>
							It seems pretty clear that some component of almost everything man made, will be connected to the internet. Cars are included in those man-made objects and like many other objects today, they are getting 'smarter' each year. By 'smarter' I specifically mean that they are equiped with increasing functionality. Cars are connected to the internet, producing their own wifi, and even running their own applications. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							However, as of right now, the car key in it's current form has limited function. Even the keys of some of the most highly regarded 'smartest' cars of today, like a Tesla Model S, offer the same range of functionality as a 2004 Honda Accord in terms of their functionality. The current version of the basic electronic battery-powered car key has but a few functions: unlocking a vehicle remotely, locking a vehicle remotely, setting a vehicle into 'panic' mode, and possibly opening a trunk.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							But what if you were to take the car key and tap into the multifunctional modes of the car via technology. By letting go of a purely physical form, a better car key could better communicate with the smarter cars of today. But what would it look like? What would it feel like? What type of micro-interactions would it have? How would it be useful to the user?

                        <p>
                            My goal is to explore these questions and arrive a possible solution using a microinteraction. Hopefully that microinteraction will be unique enought to be a 'branded' and signiture.

						<h2>Microinteraction Breakdown</h2>
                        
                        <p>
							Before I began thinking about the project too deeply, I picked up Dan Saffer's, <i>Designing Microinteractions</i>. I just skimmed the book, but it was incredibly helpful in guiding my thoughts about microinteractions. He breaks the  of the anatomy of a microinteraction into four simple components: 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Triggers</li>
                            <li>Rules </li>
                            <li>Feedback</li>
                            <li>Loops</li> 
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Just having a simple vocabulary of the microinteraction helped me approach the task of desiging a unique or signature microinteraction.

                        <h2>Batman and the Batmobile</h2>
                        
						<p>
							With my better-informed vocabulary about microinteractions, I began to think about the various triggers there are to start a car. The average person is pretty limited to one main interaction when it comes to the ignition of a vehicle; put the key in the ignition and turn to start the vehicle.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							However, there is one person who has many ways to start a vehicle. Batman.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I began thinking about the different ways Batman could interact with his gadgets to start the Batmobile remotely. In the comics and movies, Batman could start the Batmobile from his wrist microphone (much like an apple watch), simply by being a certain proximity, it could start from a timer, or it could he could simple push a button to start the car.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These initial thoughts inspired the initial triggers of the microinteraction between the user's car and the user's mobile phone application. While the microinteractions could be built out for any of those triggers, I decided to focus on the one that required 'pushing a button' to start because it was the most adaptable to the mobile platform.

						<h2>Initial Hunch</h2>
						
                        <p>
                            Soon after settling on the general type of trigger to persue for the microinteraction, I began thinking of ways to make it a 'signature' microinteraction. I began to wander into the territory of metaphor, and really wanted to use the motions of a key into an ignition. This was represented in three main motions: the insertion, the turn, and the release. I was pretty driven to integrate those motions into the interaction of the app to create a 'signature' microinteraction.  
                        </p>

                        <h2>Sketching out the Microinteraction</h2>
						
                        <p>
							Some of my initial sketches that followed the 'key' metaphor pretty thouroghly (which you can see in the early sketches). Most of the early sketches try to detail the anatomy by seqeuntially focusing on three main points: triggers, feedback, and rules. 
						</p>

                        <p>
							I even began to move beyond and sketching other tasks that were beyond the scope of just turning on the vehicle with the app. Some other tasks were.

						<h2>Building the Paper Prototype</h2>
						
						<p>
							I had diffuculty on how to build a paper prototype because my initial gestures I thought were so important to the application were dificult to build into a prototype using just paper materials. Swiping, dragging, and sliding were crutial actions that a user had to take to finish the. I struggled thinking of how do you provide the neccessary feedback to the user during a test with a paper prototype?
						</p>
                        
                        <p>
							I found inspirations in the other student's designs of the prototypes, and eventually settled on a rather intricate prototype. Below is an example of the initial paper prototype that I built with some tasks to show how the interactions would work.

                        <h2>Testing Users</h2>
						<p>
							While there were only a handful of users I tested with. With my testing I tried to concetrate on the what kind of vocabulary user called the elements on the screen and wether or not the main microinteraction went smoothly.

							The feedback I recieved from tests was very helpful and pushed my designs into a better form of the app. The redesigns abandoned most of the rigidity of the 'key' metaphor. Althought I have yet to test it, I think it would greatly reduce the friction of the microinteraction while still keeping some of its uniqueness..

                            My goals of animating really wanted focus attention. Meaning that when states changed from, unactive, to pressed, to active the animation should be obvious to the user. 
                            
                            My secondary goals were thinking about how to make it look nice and pretty.

                        <p>
							After a project, I feel like another round of user testing could definitely be conducted with a revised script and task list. That's how I always feel about these projects though.
                        </p>
                        
						<p>
							There's so much to consider when moving forward. Besides building an interactive high-fidelity prototype, obvisously the work could really benefit from refining the keyframes into a nicely animated motion study. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
							I also believe there's a lot more thought that could be refined is within the loop portion of this micro interaction. Beyond the broader feedback loop between the car and the user's smartphone application, how could smaller loops be used within the microinteraction to enhance user behavior? Is it a loop that learns, and builds frequently used presets into the 
                            
                        </p>
                        
						<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
						
						<p>
							Overall, this project served as an excellent introduction to the world of microinteractions. I feel like a whole new world opened up, and even though I only caught a glimpse into it, the process of creating a custom 'signature' microinteraction was challenging and extremely rewarding. 
                            
                            It's still amazing that something so small, like a tiny microinteraction could be taken to such detail. An interaction hich could last only a few seconds with the user
