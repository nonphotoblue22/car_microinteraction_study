						<h2>A multifunction car key for a multifunctional car</h2>
						
						<p>
							It seems pretty clear that some component of almost everything man made, will be connected to the internet. Cars are included in those man-made objects and like many other objects today, they are getting 'smarter' each year. By 'smarter' I specifically mean that they are equiped with increasing functionality. Cars are connected to the internet, producing their own wifi, and even running their own applications. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							However, as of right now, the car key in it's current form has limited function. Even the keys of some of the most highly regarded 'smartest' cars of today, like a Tesla Model S, offer the same range of functionality as a 2004 Honda Accord in terms of their functionality. The current version of the basic electronic battery-powered car key has but a few functions: unlocking a vehicle remotely, locking a vehicle remotely, setting a vehicle into 'panic' mode, and possibly opening a trunk.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							But what if you were to take the car key and tap into the multifunctional modes of the car via technology. By letting go of a purely physical form, a better car key could better communicate with the smarter cars of today. But what would it look like? What would it feel like? What type of micro-interactions would it have? How would it be useful to the user?
                            
						</p>
                        <p>
                            My goal is to explore these questions and arrive a possible solution using a microinteraction. Hopefully that microinteraction will be unique enought to be a 'branded' and signiture.

						<h2>Batman and the Batmobile</h2>
						
						<p>
							While thinking about microinteractions of a key, I first tried to just focus on one action: turning the car on.  of all the ways that an app for your multifunctional car could do. With all of these elements the fictional example but relevant example came to mind: Batman and the Batmobile. <em>Needs Editing: Doesn't make sense </em>.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Thinking about how the different ways Batman and the Batmobile helped fill in the initial triggers of the microinteraction between the user's car and the user's mobile phone application. In the comics and movies, Batman has a multitude of ways to summon the Batmobile. Batman could start the Batmobile from his wrist microphone (much like an apple watch), simply by being a certain proximity, it could start from a timer, or it could he could simple push a button to start the car.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the microinteractions could be built out for any of those triggers, I decided to focus on the one that required pushing a button to start because it was the most adaptable to the mobile platform.

						<h2>Sketching out a Microinteraction</h2>
						
						<p>
							Dan Saffer's book was incredibly helpful in guiding with the initial sketches. He breaks down the anatomy of a microinteraction into four simple components: 1) Triggers 2) Rules 3) Feedback 4) Loops. Just having a simple vocabulary of the microinteraction helped me approach the task of desiging a unique or signature microinteraction.

                        <p>
							Some of my initial sketches followed a very step-wise approach, sketching each part of the

						<h2>Building the Paper Prototype</h2>
						
						<p>
							I had diffuculty on how to build a paper prototype because my initial hunches were that gestures were so important to the application. Swiping, dragging, and sliding were crutial actions that a user had to take. How do you provide the neccessary feedback to the user via a paper prototype?
						</p>
                        
                        <p>
							Personally, I found inspirations in the other student's designs of the prototypes. I eventually settled on a rather intricate paper prototype that took some time to make, but actually worked very nicely while testing users.
